## Background

The requirement was to build a system to manage annual exams held in May each year. The system to be replaced was a manual one comprising of spreadsheets, paper forms and word documents. This system had a high administrative cost, was prone to error, and it was very difficult to produce summary reports.

Typically around 800 candidates worldwide sit for one of three qualifications. Qualifications may not be taken concurrently.
Each qualification requires multiple papers (between 2 to 5 depending on the qualification) to be passed before it can be awarded. There is no requirement to sit all the papers in the same year, and a failed paper can be retaken any number of times.

There are 35 exam centres, a centre can have more than one venue, potentially hosting more than one exam at the same time. There is a strict exam timetable each year Exams are timetabled to happen on the same day worldwide, at slightly different times to respect regional hours.

The CRM system (iMIS) is used to maintain Candidate details in an underlying SQL database. Exam candidates can be identified by a user status of EXA in the iMIS NAME table. Information about a Candidates proper name, current address, payment status etc needs to be sourced from here. Information to be maintained in the Exams system is special requirements, past exams taken, exams being taken this period, exam centre allocation.

Once papers are graded, the marks are entered into the system.

Example reporting requirements are -

- Individual report for each candidate 

## Database
A SQL Server database holds information for the objects in the system - Candidates, Exams Centres, Venues within the centre, Session timetables, and results. A partial EAR diagram is shown below.
