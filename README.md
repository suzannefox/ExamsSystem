## RSS Exams Management System 
This system was written to provide the RSS with an efficient way of managing 
their professional exams. Every year 700+ papers are taken by 200+ candidates
in several countries. The systems tracks Exam Centres, venues (centres may have 
more than one venue) and Candidates entries, special needs and individual timetable.

To be awarded a qualification a candidate may need to pass several papers, not
necessarily at the same sitting, and the system records historical passes and
the progress status of each award for each Candidate.

Candidate contact details are picked up from the central iMIS CRM.

Final award certificates are generated automatically by the system, created as a Word
document, customised for each Candidate with the exam entries contributing to the award,
the mark for those exams and the date passed.

This system replaced a complex one which used a mixture of an Access database, 
several spreadsheets, and manual paper records.
